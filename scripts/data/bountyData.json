      "description": "Levi is a creature of duality, embodying both the wild ferocity of the shark and the cunning of a pirate. He is a charismatic leader, commanding loyalty through sheer presence and a deep understanding of the people (and creatures) under his command. Ruthless when necessary, he values strength, resourcefulness, and cunning above all else. Despite his brutal reputation, he follows a personal code of honor. He protects the downtrodden and despises those who exploit the weak. His loyalty is unwavering to his crew, a band of misfits who sail aboard his ship, The Abyssal. When not plundering or hunting, Levi is prone to brooding at the ship's bow, contemplating the ever-changing tides of his life.",
